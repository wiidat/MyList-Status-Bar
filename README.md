# MyList Status Bar
UserScript for adding status bar to AniDB MyList page, 
without losing "Update Selected Anime" function.

Modified version of Seiya_L's old script:
http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/161844

**v2.0**
- now works with HTTPS
- fixed: page refreshing on expanding an anime title, script now writes code to a script class to the body of the html and works from there
(credits to tametomo, similar to external script loading but i'm paranoid about potantial issues so i changed it.

- some code cleanup
